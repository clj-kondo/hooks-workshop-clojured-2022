# Getting started

Before entering this workshop, make sure you have met the
[Prerequisites](https://github.com/clj-kondo/hooks-workshop-clojured-2022#prerequisites)
by installing clj-kondo, etc.

In this workshop I suggest working in teams of two. Preferably, team up with
someone you do _not_ know already! If you are totally new to Clojure, find
someone with a bit more experience than you, or vice versa, so you can
complement each other in this workshop.

Clone this repository on your computer, using `git clone
https://github.com/clj-kondo/hooks-workshop-clojured-2022.git`, cd into the
directory `hooks-workshop-clojured-2022` and open the project in your favorite
editor.
